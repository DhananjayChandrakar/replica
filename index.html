                <p>Ecosystem restoration means **assisting in the recovery of ecosystems that have been degraded or destroyed**, as well as conserving the ecosystems that are still intact. Healthier ecosystems, with richer biodiversity, yield greater benefits such as more fertile soils, bigger yields of timber and fish, and larger stores of greenhouse gases.</p>

                <p>Restoration can happen in many ways – for example through actively planting or by removing pressures so that nature can recover on its own. It is not always possible – or desirable – to return an ecosystem to its original state. We still need farmland and infrastructure on land that was once forest, for instance, and ecosystems, like societies, need to adapt to a changing climate.</p>

                <h2>The Economic and Climate Impact</h2>
                <p>Between now and 2030, the restoration of **350 million hectares** of degraded terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems could generate **US$9 trillion** in ecosystem services. Restoration could also remove **13 to 26 gigatons** of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The economic benefits of such interventions exceed nine times the cost of investment, whereas inaction is at least three times more costly than ecosystem restoration.</p>

                <h2>What is Ecosystem Restoration?</h2>
                <p>All kinds of ecosystems can be restored, including forests, farmlands, cities, wetlands and oceans. Restoration initiatives can be launched by almost anyone, from governments and development agencies to businesses, communities and individuals. That is because the causes of degradation are many and varied, and can have an impact at different scales.</p>

            <section class="benefits">
                <p>Restoring ecosystems large and small protects and improves the livelihoods of people who depend on them. It also helps to regulate disease and reduce the risk of natural disasters. In fact, restoration can help us achieve all of the **Sustainable Development Goals**.</p>
